# Facial Recognition App - Implementation Status

## Completed Features

1. **Core Functionality:**
   - Webcam capture and access using MediaDevices API
   - Face detection using TensorFlow.js BlazeFace model
   - Facial landmark detection using MediaPipe FaceMesh
   - Expression analysis using geometric relationships between landmarks
   - Visualization of detections, landmarks, and expressions
   
2. **Performance Optimizations:**
   - Throttled processing for landmarks and expressions
   - Adaptive frame skipping to maintain performance
   - Performance metrics tracking (FPS, detection times)
   - Adjustable throttling modes (responsive, balanced, power saver)
   
3. **UI Implementation:**
   - Rich visualization settings for bounding boxes, mesh, key points, etc.
   - Advanced control panel with visualization and performance settings
   - Performance metrics display with color-coded indicators
   - Basic and advanced UI modes
   
4. **State Management:**
   - Complete Zustand store implementation
   - Organized state with model settings, performance settings, etc.
   - Reactive UI that responds to state changes

## Next Steps

1. **Web Workers:**
   - Move processing to separate thread for better performance
   
2. **Model Optimization:**
   - Implement model quantization
   - Add progressive loading of models
   
3. **Additional Features:**
   - Save/export detection results
   - Camera selection UI for devices with multiple cameras
   - Additional mesh visualizations (3D, wireframe, etc.)
   
4. **Testing and Refinement:**
   - Comprehensive testing on various devices
   - Fallback modes for limited hardware
   - Documentation of the implementation

The app now provides a solid foundation with core facial recognition features and a responsive UI.
